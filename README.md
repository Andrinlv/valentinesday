# 💌 ValentinesDay Repository

Welcome to the **valentinesday** project! This private repository contains a simple static web page designed to celebrate Valentine's Day with a charming message and interactivity. While source code is available for review and reuse, the live pages are intended to remain private and are not publicly hosted.

## 🔍 Project Overview

The application is a lightweight HTML/CSS/JavaScript bundle that:

1. Displays a themed Valentine’s Day card.
2. Includes interactive elements (e.g. button animations, dynamic text).
3. Can be run locally by opening `index.html` in a browser.

Although minimal in size, the project is an excellent starting point for learning basic web development or for customizing your own greeting card.
